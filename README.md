Step 1: Initialize a React App
First, let's create a new React app using Create React App:

npx create-react-app weather-app
        This command will create a new directory named weather-app containing all the necessary 
       files and dependencies for a React project.

Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

cd weather-app

Step 3: Install Required Packages
We need to install Axios for making HTTP requests and Bootstrap for styling:


npm install axios bootstrap

Step 4: Get OpenWeatherMap API Key ("7edb7da774621ca7b60b3db49b774e26")
     Go to the OpenWeatherMap website and sign up for an API key.

Step 5: Set Up App.js
Replace the contents of src/App.js with the code provided in your initial question. Make sure to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key.  ("7edb7da774621ca7b60b3db49b774e26")

Step 6: Set Up App.css
Replace the contents of src/App.css with the CSS code provided in your initial question.

Step 7: Start the Development Server

npm start
   This command will start the development server, and you should see your Weather App running 
   in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Step 8: Test the App
    Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You can now input a city name and 
   click "Search" to see the weather details.

Step 9: Customize and Expand
   Feel free to customize the app further, add more features, or improve the design according 
  to your preferences and requirements.
